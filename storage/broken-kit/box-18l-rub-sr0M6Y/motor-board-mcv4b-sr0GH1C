    A revision b V4 motor board (MCv4b).

    Apparently the board emmited smoke when setting the power to 100.
    The motor connected had a stall current of 5A.
    The M1 channel H-bridge IC appears to have slight scorch marks on it.
    The STM32 has scorch marks and a small hole in it.
    There is evidence of heating on the inside of the case above the STM32.

    It's dead Jim.
