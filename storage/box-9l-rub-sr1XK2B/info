    A 9l "Really Useful Box"

    As of 2024-04-15 this RUB contains the display BeagleBoards
    and their power supplies, from when we used those (long ago),
    as well as the much more recent Pi 4s which were used for SR2024
    along with their power supplies and the mini-HDMI to HDMI cables
    needed to use them.
